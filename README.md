# spiking_neural_networks
Video coding using spiking neural networks tutorship for M1 tutorship at Nice


# How to use 

Requires to have Python installed and the brian2 library (and thus the librairies needed to use brian2).


Insert some picture as png and with height >= width in the pics folder.
Play with the values defining the neuron network by modifying the code of mainCode.py.
The modifiable code starts at line 197.
Don't forget to reference your picture's path at line 205.

Then, upon running the code, when the console is ready, input 
lifify()

And your picture with the neuron network parameters set will appear.

You can also modify the network's parameters on the top level, then run lifify() again.
